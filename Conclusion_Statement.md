Which model has a lower loss?
    LSTM Stock predictor had a lower loss across the board.
    
Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
    The fear and greed index has a better prediction of actual values over time. LSTM predicted is a thousand off from the actual whereas FNG is only off by   mostly less than 100.

Which window size works best for the model?
    Best window size is between 1 and 2.
